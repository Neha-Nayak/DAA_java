Programs under <b> Design and Analysis of algorithms </b> include the follwing.<br/><br/>
1.<br/>
    a. Create a Java class called Student with the following details as variables within it.
    (i) USN
    (ii) Name
    (iii) Programme
    (iv) Phone
    Write a Java program to create nStudent objects and print the USN, Name, Programme, and 
    Phoneof these objects with suitable headings.<br/>
    b. Write a Java program to implement the Stack using arrays. Write Push(), Pop(), and 
    Display() methods to demonstrate its working. <br/><br/>
2.<br/>
    a. Design a superclass called Staff with details as StaffId, Name, Phone, Salary. Extend this 
    class by writing three subclasses namely Teaching (domain, publications), Technical
    (skills), and Contract (period). Write a Java program to read and display at least 3 staff
    objects of all three categories.<br/>
    b. Write a Java class called Customer to store their name and date_of_birth. The date_of_birth 
    format should be dd/mm/yyyy. Write methods to read customer data as <name, 
    dd/mm/yyyy> and display as <name, dd, mm, yyyy> using StringTokenizer class 
    considering the delimiter character as “/”.<br/><br/>
3.<br/>
    a. Write a Java program to read two integers a andb. Compute a/b and print, when b is not zero. 
    Raise an exception when b is equal to zero.<br/>
    b. Write a Java program that implements a multi-thread application that has three threads. First 
    thread generates a random integer for every 1 second; second thread computes the square of 
    the number andprints; third thread will print the value of cube of the number.<br/><br/>
4. Sort a given set of n integer elements using Quick Sort method and compute its time 
complexity. Run the program for varied values of n> 5000 and record the time taken to sort. 
Plot a graph of the time taken versus non graph sheet. The elements can be read from a file 
or can be generated using the random number generator. Demonstrate using Java how the 
divide-and-conquer method works along with its time complexity analysis: worst case, 
average case and best case.<br/><br/>
5. Sort a given set of n integer elements using Merge Sort method and compute its time 
complexity. Run the program for varied values of n> 5000, and record the time taken to 
sort. Plot a graph of the time taken versus non graph sheet. The elements can be read from a 
file or can be generated using the random number generator. Demonstrate using Java how 
the divide-and-conquer method works along with its time complexity analysis: worst case, 
average case and best case.<br/><br/>
6. Implement in Java, the 0/1 Knapsack problem using (a) Dynamic Programming method (b) 
Greedy method.<br/><br/>
7. From a given vertex in a weighted connected graph, find shortest paths to other vertices 
using Dijkstra's algorithm. Write the program in Java.<br/><br/>
8. Find Minimum Cost Spanning Tree of a given connected undirected graph using 
Kruskal'salgorithm. Use Union-Find algorithms in your program<br/><br/>
9. Find Minimum Cost Spanning Tree of a given connected undirected graph using
Prim's algorithm.<br/><br/>
10. Write Java programs to <br/>
(a) Implement All-Pairs Shortest Paths problem using Floyd's algorithm.<br/>
(b) Implement Travelling Sales Person problem using Dynamic programming.<br/><br/>
